# MobilePrism - A Mobile App for PhotoPrism
MobilePrism is designed to create an app similar to Google Photos. PhotoPrism offers all the [features](https://photoprism.app/features) to implement such an app. There are still many things left on our to-do list, but we want to make MobilePrism available right now.

Our goal is to stay comaptible with the latest version of PhotoPrism. Follow [this guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) to install PhotoPrism on your home computer or cloud.

Currently only images can be displayed in this app. Support for videos, gifs and so on will be added in future versions.

## Installation
Download the latest APK for Android under releases or [here](https://github.com/bleibdirtroy/MobilePrism/releases).

Future releases will be available on F-Droid, Google Playstore and the Apple App Store. Yes, an iOS app will be available too.

## Features
MobilePrism uses a local database to store loaded albums and photos. Therefore, the content can be viewed offline. The content can be synced with the PhotoPrism server whenever the user wants to by simply draging down (as it is know from all sorts of apps). Every album and the timeline is synced individually to allow the user to update/download just the content he wants to sync. 

- <b>login</b> - Use your credentials to log into your own PhotoPrism server or try a public instance
- <b>timeline</b> - View your PhotoPrism pictures in chronological order sorted by month and year
- <b>albums</b> - View your PhotoPrism albums 
- <b>caching</b> - Pictures are cached on your device and can be viewed offline
- <b>settings</b> - Preload your timeline or clear the cache
