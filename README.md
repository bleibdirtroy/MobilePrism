# MobilePrism - A Mobile App for PhotoPrism
MobilePrism is designed to create an app similar to goole photos. PhotoPrism offers all the [features](https://photoprism.app/features) to implement such an app. There are still many things left on our to-do list, but we want to make MobilePrism available right now.
