# MobilePrism: Your mobile app for PhotoPrism
MobilePrism is designed to create an app similar to goole photos. PhotoPrism offers all the [features](https://photoprism.app/features) to implement such an app. There are still many things left on our to-do list, but we want to make MobilePrism available right now.

Our goal is to stay comaptible with the latest version of PhotoPrism. Follow [this guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) to install PhotoPrism on your home computer or cloud.

Currently only images can be displayed in this app. Support for videos, gifs and so on will be added in future versions.
